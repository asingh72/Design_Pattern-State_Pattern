"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.”

My Assignments output is based on following calculation:

1) Total number of travelers(total number of travelers since day one, not for current day)
2) Total number of days
3) Total number of prohibited items(total number of prohibited items since day one, not from current day)

4) Average Traffic Per Day = Total number of travelers ÷ Total number of days
5) Average Prohibited Items Per Day = Total number of prohibited items ÷ Total number of days
